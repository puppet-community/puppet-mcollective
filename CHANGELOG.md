2014-09-03 Release 2.0.0
========================

Summary:

This is a fairly large rewrite of many parts of the mcollective module to
remove the management of activemq and rabbitmq (middleware) since this task
should be delegated to activemq/rabbitmq modules. See the examples/ directory
for example profiles to replicate previous configuration.

Backwards-incompatible Features:
- Removed the management of activemq and rabbitmq
- Removed the following parameters:
  - mcollective::middleware
  - mcollective::activemq\_template
	- mcollective::activemq\_memoryUsage
	- mcollective::activemq\_storeUsage
	- mcollective::activemq\_tempUsage
	- mcollective::activemq\_console
	- mcollective::activemq\_config
	- mcollective::activemq\_confdir
	- mcollective::rabbitmq\_confdir
	- mcollective::rabbitmq\_vhost
	- mcollective::delete\_guest\_user

Features:
- Make the confdir configurable
- Added callerid param for mcollective::user
- Replace facts.yaml pattern with cron job
- Allow mcollective::collectives to be an array
- Added the following parameters to class mcollective:
  - client\_package
	- confdir
	- rabbitmq\_vhost
	- service\_name
	- server\_package
	- ruby\_stomp\_package
	- ssl\_client\_certs\_dir

Bugfixes:
- Honor yaml\_fact\_path parameter in all the relevant places
- Use string for host\_iteration titles in future parser, as integers are not
allowed as titles

- Add last\_run to the list of dynamic facts that are filtered out.

2013-10-11 Release 1.1.0
========================

Summary:

This release adds `delete_guest_user` for RabbitMQ so that you don't have an
admin guest user left enabled.  It also adds `middleware_admin_user` and

the middleware appropriately.  The README has been updated with further
information.

Features:
- Add $delete\_guest\_user functionality.
- Add middleware\_admin\_user and middleware\_admin\_password parameters.
- Don't supply a client.cfg when securityprovider is 'ssl'

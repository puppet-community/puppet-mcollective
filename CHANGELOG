2013-10-11 Release 1.1.0

Summary:

This release adds `delete_guest_user` for RabbitMQ so that you don't have an
admin guest user left enabled.  It also adds `middleware_admin_user` and
`middleware_admin_password` so that you can control the user that's created in
the middleware appropriately.  The README has been updated with further
information.

Features:
- Add $delete_guest_user functionality.
- Add middleware_admin_user and middleware_admin_password parameters.
- Don't supply a client.cfg when securityprovider is 'ssl'

Fixes:
- Use hash to build anonymous hash (in order to not require future parser)
